# Project

This project focuses on implementing the Mafia game using an FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array). The game, involving a standoff between Mafia members and citizens, starts with four citizens and two Mafia. Mafia members are aware of each other's identities, whereas citizens must identify and vote to execute suspected Mafia during the day. At night, Mafia assassinate citizens. The game ends when all Mafia are executed or they outnumber the citizens. Our goal is to utilize FPGA to visualize the game's status with different colored LEDs, allowing players to interact and change the game's state through direct input.
